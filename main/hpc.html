    <h1>BITING BANTER</h1>
    <h5>In Collaboration with Boet Bouten & Trent Eriksen</h5>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>
      Biting Banter is an experimental hardware project developed during the Hardware & Physical Computing course in the 
      Media Technology MSc program at Leiden University. The system allows two users to communicate using Morse code—one 
      by biting a custom mouthpiece, the other by receiving haptic feedback through a vibrating bracelet. The concept reimagines 
      a haptic communication technique originally intended for deafblind users, but shifts its purpose toward a more playful and 
      performative interaction.

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
          The system is built around a force-sensitive resistor embedded in a modified AirTag case. When bitten, 
          the sensor registers short and long presses, which are converted into Morse code via custom Arduino 
          code. A small screen displays the interpreted letters, while the receiving user feels the corresponding 
          vibrations on their wrist. The prototype went through multiple iterations, including challenges with 
          moisture protection, wire length, and signal clarity. Gesture thresholds were adjusted repeatedly to 
          account for the different timing patterns between users, and the team collectively tested and fine-tuned 
          every component together.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          While the idea originated from assistive communication research, our goal was not to replicate a 
          practical tool but to open it up as a strange and tactile form of interaction. Accuracy is part of the 
          challenge, but not the point—the system invites users to engage with unfamiliar rhythms and 
          limitations. Most users quickly understood the logic, even without prior knowledge of Morse code, and 
          learned to adapt their input style. Biting Banter is not about fluency, but about experimentation, 
          attention, and the weird intimacy of sending a message through your teeth.
