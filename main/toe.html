        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>
          TOE-ViR24 is a distributed, narrative-driven installation developed as part of the Science to Experience course within the Media Technology Exhibition – LIVING. Initially, we were tasked with creating an exhibit responding to the theme of "living"—a prompt that opened questions not just about biology, but about behavior, systems, and cognition. Our output, TOE-ViR24, is an interactive exploration of how ideas can exhibit life-like properties. By drawing an analogy between viral replication and conceptual transmission, the work invites participants to reframe what it means for something to be alive.

            <h2>Concept and Goals</h2>
            <p>
              The installation builds on anthropologist  <a href = "https://medium.com/re-assembling-reality/what-is-life-139cdd7017e6." target="_blank">David A. Palmer’s suggestion</a> that theories and ideas may be considered "alive" if we assess them by their behavior rather than their substance. Just like biological viruses, ideas rely on hosts, mutate under influence, and spread through interaction. TOE-ViR24 proposes that thoughts themselves are “cognitive viruses”—dynamic, evolving entities that live through us.

          <p>
            The experience unfolds as a multi-station installation resembling a treasure hunt. Each station introduces a new dimension of the fictional virus TOE-ViR24, drawing from formats such as public health bulletins, anatomical models, and interactive games. Visitors collect clues in the form of letters, which form a password required to access the final stage.
          </p>
          <p>-> Segmented structure: Each stage presents the virus through a distinct medium or interaction.</p>
          <p>-> Gradual reveal: Initially plausible, the virus becomes increasingly strange—eventually revealed to be an idea itself.</p>
          <p>-> Tracking ‘infections’: A digital counter at the entrance logged every person who completed the full journey and thus became “infected.”</p>

          <p>
            Rather than taking a literal or didactic route, the installation plays with ambiguity. Visitors are encouraged to question inconsistencies in the virus’s description, gradually coming to suspect that TOE-ViR24 is not a biological entity. This slow unveiling invites personal interpretation and recontextualization of earlier interactions.

      <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
      <p>
        TOE-ViR24 transforms the exhibition theme of LIVING into a speculative inquiry: if ideas need minds to live, are they not living beings too? Through interaction and reflection, visitors uncover the metaphorical nature of the virus—and in doing so, begin to see themselves as carriers.
      </p>
      <h3>
        By the end of the exhibition, over 100 visitors had been “infected” with TOE-ViR24, each carrying with them a small shift in how they think about knowledge, life, and contagion.
