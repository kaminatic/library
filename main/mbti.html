    <h1>INVESTIGATING CORRELATIONS<br>BETWEEN ZODIAC SIGNS AND 16<br>PERSONALITIES ASSESSMENT</h1>
    <h2>in collaboration with Boet Bouten</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p><em>
        This project was developed as part of the Playful & Creative Science course. It explores whether any statistical relationship exists between two popular systems of personality categorization: zodiac signs and the NERIS Type Explorer model (commonly known as the "16 Personalities" test). Though widely used and culturally prominent, these systems have rarely been studied in direct comparison.

      <h3>Research Focus</h3>
      <p>
        The project examines if specific zodiac signs are associated with particular personality dimensions from the NERIS model, which combines the Myers-Briggs and Big Five frameworks. Using a quantitative approach, the study aims to assess whether any significant correlations exist and how strong they are.

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        165 participants completed the 16 Personalities test and reported their zodiac signs and dates of birth. The results were analyzed using chi-square tests and Cramer’s V to evaluate associations between zodiac signs and each of the five personality dimensions. To account for low cell counts, additional tests grouped zodiac signs by elemental triplicity (Fire, Earth, Air, Water).

      <h3>Findings</h3>
      <p>
        No significant correlations were found between individual zodiac signs or grouped elements and personality dimensions. All p-values exceeded the threshold of α = 0.05, and Cramer’s V indicated only weak associations. The results suggest no meaningful statistical relationship between the two classification systems.

      <h3>Reflections</h3>
      <p><em>
        While the results align with prior empirical studies that found no support for astrological influence on personality, the project revealed high public interest: 167 survey responses were gathered in under five days. The study highlights the limits of quantitative analysis for topics rooted in self-attribution and cultural meaning, suggesting future research could benefit from a qualitative or mixed-methods approach.
