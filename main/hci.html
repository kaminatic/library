    <h1>HOLO-ANATO-GRAM</h1>
    <h5>In Collaboration with Ferid Kendić</h5>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>
      Holo-Anato-Gram is a research and design project developed for the Human-Computer Interaction in Interactive Visualizations course. 
      It investigates how pyramid holograms, combined with gesture-based interaction, can enhance the learning experience in subjects 
      that rely on spatial understanding—such as anatomy, archaeology, and geology. The prototype presents anatomical models in three 
      dimensions using a holographic display, allowing users to interact with them via hand gestures tracked by a Leap Motion sensor.

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
      The project responds to a common problem in higher education and museums: the limitations of two-dimensional learning in spatially complex fields. 
      Traditional approaches often fail to support students’ spatial visualization and cognitive load, especially in domains like anatomy where layered, 
      volumetric understanding is critical. The core goal of the project was to develop a functional, interactive system where users could rotate, explore, 
      and label anatomical models in 3D, and to assess whether this format supports better engagement and comprehension.

            <h2>Technology and Interaction</h2>
            <p>
            The prototype combines a Leap Motion controller, Unity 3D, and a custom-built pyramid hologram to visualize and control 3D models. 
            An external screen provides an interface where users can switch models, select layers, and toggle anatomical labels. 
            Gestures are tracked in real time to enable interaction without physical input devices. The system supports both adult and children modes, 
            based on user personas created during the initial design phase.
            </p>

            <h2>Development Highlights</h2>
            <p>
            The project followed an iterative process, with four rounds of evaluations. Early testing used wireframes and a non-functional hologram 
            to gather initial feedback. Later versions allowed real-time interaction with the holographic display.
            Evaluators included both experts and users across age groups. Feedback led to improvements in gesture ergonomics, 
            color accessibility, and instructional clarity.
            While technical constraints required a switch from iPad to an external screen for the final prototype, 
            the Leap Motion interface remained the central interaction modality.
            </p>

            <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
            <p>
            Evaluations showed overwhelmingly positive responses: users found the system easy to use, visually engaging, 
            and effective in supporting exploratory learning. Participants expressed interest in using the holographic system frequently, 
            both in educational and public exhibition contexts. The research suggests that even simple holography setups can meaningfully 
            improve spatial learning by freeing up cognitive load and encouraging more active engagement with complex models.
