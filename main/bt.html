            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <h3>Better Together is a mechanical ballet performed by five small robots, each looping through its own quirky movement routine set to the sweeping sounds of Tchaikovsky. Despite having no sensors or awareness of one another, they appear to communicate—gliding, hesitating, and occasionally tumbling into moments of unexpected harmony. This project was developed as part of the Artificial Creatures course.</h3>

            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>This piece asks what it means to act together. If the illusion of collectivity can be choreographed without interaction, is it any less real? These robots were never meant to collaborate—yet when placed in a shared space and timed to a common rhythm, something larger unfolds.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Each creature has its own “personality,” expressed through a distinct, pre-programmed path. Their mecanum wheels allow fluid movement in all directions, while colorful LEDs tint their moods. Though the choreography is rigid, the overall performance feels alive—fragile, emergent, and strangely relatable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Making Meaning</h2>
                <p>The robots don’t respond to you. They don’t respond to each other. But when they move—awkward and earnest, like swimmers in an invisible pool—something happens. Their independence begins to read as connection. Their loops begin to speak.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why Togetherness?</h2>
                <p>Because one jiggly little robot is just that. But five? Five can almost dance.</p>

        <h2>Night of discoveries</h2>
        <p>In September 2024, we were invited to participate in the Critters on Stage expo taking place at the Night of Discoveries festival. It was an absolute pleasure to present our creatures and let them truly shine in front of an audience. Performing as a warm up to <a href ="https://acrobot.nl/" target="_blank">Acrobot by Daniel Simu</a>, Zip Kip, Dip and Rip had a blast on the stage a got a lot of praise, attention and curiosity from the crowd, especially the one of young age. </p>
